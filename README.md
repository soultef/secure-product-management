# Spring Boot E-Commerce Application
This project is a Spring Boot-based e-commerce application that allows administrators to manage products securely through a web interface. The application follows the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture and integrates key features such as role-based access control, Thymeleaf for form handling, and Spring Boot Actuator for application monitoring.

# Key Features
## 1. MVC Architecture
   The application is structured using the MVC design pattern.
## 2. Product Management
   Secure functionality to create, update, and display products.
   Each product has attributes such as name, price, description, and category.
## 3. User Roles and Security
   Implement role-based access control (RBAC) with two user roles:
   USER: Can view products.
   ADMIN: Can create, update, and delete products.
   Uses Spring Security to manage authentication and authorization.
## 4. Thymeleaf Forms
   Thymeleaf is used for creating and rendering forms for product management (e.g., adding and updating products).
   The application provides a user-friendly interface for managing product data.
## 5. Spring Boot Actuator
   Actuator endpoints are enabled to monitor the health and performance of the application.
   Provides endpoints such as /actuator/health and /actuator/metrics to monitor application metrics.
 # Project Setup
   ### Prerequisites
   Java 11 or newer
   Maven
   An IDE (e.g., IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse)
   Database MySQL
  ### Steps to Run the Application
   #### 1.Clone the repository:

      git clone https://github.com/soultef/spring-boot-ecommerce.git
      cd spring-boot-ecommerce
      
   #### 2.Install dependencies:
      mvn clean install

   #### 3.Configure application properties:
      # Example database configuration
      spring.datasource.url=jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/ecommerce
      spring.datasource.username=root
      spring.datasource.password=root

   #### 4.Run the application:
      mvn spring-boot:run

Once the application is running, open your browser and go to:
http://localhost:8080
<!-- These username and password is for development perpose only-->
      Default User Roles
      ADMIN:
      Username: admin

##### Add product (Admin only):
   /products/add
##### Update product (Admin only):
   /products/{id}/edit
##### Delete product (Admin only):
 /products/{id}/delete

## Monitoring with Spring Boot Actuator:

# Application health: /actuator/health
## Metrics: /actuator/metrics
