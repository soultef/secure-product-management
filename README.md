Spring Boot E-Commerce Application
This project is a Spring Boot-based e-commerce application that allows administrators to manage products securely through a web interface. The application follows the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture and integrates key features such as role-based access control, Thymeleaf for form handling, and Spring Boot Actuator for application monitoring.

Key Features
1. MVC Architecture
   The application is structured using the MVC design pattern.
   Model: Represents the application's data (e.g., Product entities).
   View: HTML views are rendered using Thymeleaf templates.
   Controller: Handles HTTP requests and delegates business logic to services.
2. Product Management
   Secure functionality to create, update, and display products.
   Each product has attributes such as name, price, description, and category.
3. User Roles and Security
   Implement role-based access control (RBAC) with two user roles:
   USER: Can view products.
   ADMIN: Can create, update, and delete products.
   Uses Spring Security to manage authentication and authorization.
4. Thymeleaf Forms
   Thymeleaf is used for creating and rendering forms for product management (e.g., adding and updating products).
   The application provides a user-friendly interface for managing product data.
5. Spring Boot Actuator
   Actuator endpoints are enabled to monitor the health and performance of the application.
   Provides endpoints such as /actuator/health and /actuator/metrics to monitor application metrics.
